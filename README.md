# Linear Regression Model

This code snippet demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model using PyTorch. The model is defined as a class called `TimsLinearRegressionModel`, which inherits from the `nn.Module` class provided by PyTorch.

## Model Architecture

The `TimsLinearRegressionModel` class has two parameters: `weights` and `bias`. These parameters are initialized randomly using `torch.randn` in the constructor method `__init__`. Both parameters have their `requires_grad` flag set to `True`, indicating that their gradients should be computed during the training process.

## Computation Method

The `forward` method of the model performs the actual computation. It takes a tensor `x` as input and returns the predicted output tensor using the linear regression formula: `y = weights * x + bias`. Here, `weights` and `bias` are the parameters of the model, and `x` represents the input data.

## Usage

To use this linear regression model, you can follow these steps:

1. Instantiate an object of the `TimsLinearRegressionModel` class:

> model = TimsLinearRegressionModel()

2. Prepare your input data as a PyTorch tensor:
> x = torch.tensor(...) # Replace ... with your actual input data

3. Pass the input tensor through the model to obtain the predicted output:
> y_pred = model(x)


4. You can now use `y_pred` for further analysis or evaluation.

## Training

To train this linear regression model, you will need a dataset consisting of input-output pairs `(x, y)`. You can use techniques like gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent to optimize the model's parameters (`weights` and `bias`) based on a loss function.

During the training process, you will need to compute the model's output using the `forward` method, calculate the loss between the predicted output and the true output (`y`), and backpropagate the gradients to update the parameters. This iterative process is typically performed for multiple epochs until the model converges to a satisfactory solution.
